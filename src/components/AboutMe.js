            <p>I'm Currently in Austin, TX by way of Cleveland. I'm a graduate of Thinkful's FullStack Web
            Developer
            program.
            I came from a background of basically only knowing how to turn a computer on, so learning how to code
            was
            quite the jump. But as I continue to learn I find that I'm loving the creative freedom coding gives you.
            I am currently using what I've learned doing freelance and personal work.
